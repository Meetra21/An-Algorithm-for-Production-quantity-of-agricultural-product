# G-Syrup Production Forecasting  

This project builds a **time-series forecasting model** to predict the **monthly production of G-syrup** across 10 provinces using both production history and environmental factors.  

Grople syrup is derived from a fruit that takes months to grow and a few days to process into syrup. The dataset spans **January 2015 â€“ December 2020** for production quantities, and includes related environmental datasets to help capture the effects of climate and vegetation on yield.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal  

- Predict **monthly G-syrup production (tonnes)** for each province.  
- Incorporate **weather, soil, and vegetation features** into the forecasting model.  
- Explore advanced models such as **ARIMA, LSTM, GRU, and hybrid ML/DL methods** for improved accuracy.

## ðŸ§­ Workflow  

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**  
- Aggregate daily/8-day datasets into **monthly values**.  
- Handle missing data via interpolation and smoothing.  
- Normalize and scale features for deep learning models.  

### 2. **Feature Engineering**  
- Climate indices: rolling averages, seasonal lag variables.  
- Vegetation indices (NDVI trends).  
- Temporal features: month, seasonality indicators.  

### 3. **Possible Modeling Approaches**  
- **Classical models**: ARIMA, SARIMA for baseline forecasting.  
- **Machine Learning models**: Random Forest, XGBoost.  
- **Deep Learning models**:  
  - LSTM and GRU for sequential learning.  
  - Hybrid models combining weather + vegetation + production time series.  

### 4. **Evaluation**  
- Metrics:  
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)  
- Cross-validation across multiple provinces.
